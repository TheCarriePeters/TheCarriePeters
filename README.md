Hello! I'm Carrie, a self-guided dev student currently enrolled in Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" on Udemy. My goal is to gain the skills necessary to start working on freelance projects and applying for jobs as either a data scientist or software engineer. I haven't decided which I have a preference for, but I'm sure I'll learn with more experience.
